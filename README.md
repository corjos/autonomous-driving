# autonomous-driving
Code for use in my autonomous driving research. Consists of largely-independent python packages
making heavy use of the numpy/scipy stack.

# Packages
* ##hgmm:
    A package implementing Frank Havlak's hybrid gaussian mixture model algorithm.
* ##collision:
    A package implementing Jason Hardy's fast collision probabilty algorithm between 
    two convex polygonal objects, one of which has an uncertain position.
