# autonomous-driving
Code for use in my autonomous driving research. Consists of largely-independent python packages
making heavy use of the numpy/scipy stack. 

If you have any questions about or problems with the code please contact me jwc292@cornell.edu

## Packages
* **hgmm**: 

    A package implementing Frank Havlak's hybrid gaussian mixture model algorithm.
* **collision**:

    A package implementing Jason Hardy's fast collision probabilty algorithm between 
    two convex polygonal objects, one of which has an uncertain position.
